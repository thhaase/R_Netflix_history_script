# Netflix_Plots.R

## Plot your Netflix viewing history 

-------

- I used most of the plots from [Sa√∫l Buentello](shorturl.at/enFWZ) so he takes most of the credit.

- I use Linux Mint, I have no Idea if the script will work on your PC

-------
# How to use:
1. Download your netflix history. This is done by signing into your netflix account, clicking your icon in the top right corner, then click _account_. Now choose your profile and click on _view_ next to _Vieweing activity_. Now scroll down and _Download all_.

2. put the script and your viewing history in one folder

3. open the terminal and navigate to the Folder

4. execute the script with     
   ```sh
   Rscript Netflix_Plots.R
   ```
5. enter the filename of your netflix history file without the _.csv_ extension
